-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A multithreaded vanity account generating tool for the Ripple p2p network.
For performance reasons, only prefix search is currently supported.

Requires Boost and OpenSSL.

Build: ./make
Run:   ./ripplegen [--threads=<thread_count>] [--input=<path_to_file>]

The threads parameter is optional. If omitted, the optimal value is selected
depending on your hardware. The input file must contain one prefix per line.
The generator will run forever, writing all found matches to standard output
and .dat files in current location.

TODO:
    - Remove unused portions of source code.
    
    - Introdue prefix/suffix/regex (+case sensitivity) modes

    - Improve performance by removing unnecessary branching,
      excessive calls, unnecessary memory allocations and copies,
      and replacing the elliptic curve library with something faster.

    - Allow user to specify the seed and then search accounts for that
      seed (right now uses a hardcoded index of 0 for each seed).

    - The search space is sufficiently ample so that it is highly
      unlikely that two threads will end up overlapping in their
      search range, or that running the program multiple times with
      the same pattern will result in an overlap. But it's very cheap
      to guarantee this won't happen. Moreover, the user could be
      allowed to provide an initial search value either directly or as a
      passphrase hash (although this can compromise security).

    - Support for coordinated searches across many machines.

Based on original RippleGen by Eric Lombrozo (github.com/CodeSharp).
After being developed only with Visual Studio on Windows, any compatibility
with other environment is not guaranted. Original makefile is left here
should somebody need it.
